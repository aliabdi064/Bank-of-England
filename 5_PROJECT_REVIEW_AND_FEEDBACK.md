# Project Review and Final Feedback

## 1. Overall Assessment
This is a high-quality data science project that successfully meets the requirements of the exercise. The analysis is thorough, the code is clean, and the findings are well-communicated. The project demonstrates a strong end-to-end capability in data analysis and machine learning.

## 2. Key Improvement: Handling High-Cardinality Features
A significant improvement was made by changing how high-cardinality categorical features (`Town`, `County`) are handled.

*   **Previous Method:** One-Hot Encoding, which created a very wide and sparse dataset of over 1500 features.
*   **Optimized Method:** Using LightGBM's built-in support for categorical features. This is more memory-efficient and often leads to better performance by allowing the model to create more optimal splits.

**Performance Comparison:**
*   **Original LightGBM R²:** 0.6057
*   **Optimized LightGBM R²:** 0.6082

This change has resulted in a noticeable improvement in the model's predictive power.

## 3. Suggestions for Further Improvement

To further increase the model's predictive accuracy (beyond the current ~60.82%), consider the following advanced techniques:

### a. More Advanced Feature Engineering
*   **Target Encoding:** For categorical features, you could replace each category with the average price for that category. This can be very powerful but must be done carefully to avoid data leakage (e.g., by calculating the means on the training set only or using a cross-validation approach).
*   **Interaction Features:** Create features that combine two or more existing features. For example, the average price of a `Property Type` within a specific `County` could be a very predictive feature.

### b. Advanced Modeling Techniques
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization (e.g., with `Optuna` or `Hyperopt`) to find the absolute best set of parameters for your LightGBM model. This can often squeeze out several percentage points of performance.
*   **Ensemble Modeling (Stacking):** Combine the predictions of multiple models. A common approach is "stacking":
    1.  Train several different base models (e.g., LightGBM, XGBoost, and maybe a linear model like Ridge).
    2.  Use the predictions of these base models as input features for a final "meta-model" (e.g., a simple linear regression).
    This technique often outperforms any single model.
*   **Deep Learning:** For a dataset of this size, a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or a more complex neural network could also be effective, especially with entity embeddings for the categorical features.

### c. Robust Evaluation
*   **Cross-Validation:** Instead of a single train-test split, use k-fold cross-validation to get a more reliable estimate of your model's performance on unseen data. This involves splitting the data into 'k' folds and training the model 'k' times, each time using a different fold as the test set.

## 4. Conclusion
The project is in a very strong state. By implementing the optimized categorical feature handling, you have already improved the model's performance. The suggestions above represent the next steps you could take to push the model's accuracy even higher, moving from a good model to a state-of-the-art one.
